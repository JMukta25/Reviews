# Reviews

The review assignment involved creating a web application that fetches data from a JSON server containing diverse reviews. One of the key features implemented was the Review Highlighter, which dynamically highlights portions of reviews based on sentiment analysis. Each sentiment category is assigned a distinct color code, enhancing the user's ability to quickly grasp the overall tone of the review. Additionally, the application incorporated Tooltip functionality, providing users with brief, informative descriptions when hovering over specific review elements. The design focused on responsiveness and user-friendliness, ensuring an optimal experience across various devices. Overall, the project successfully combined data fetching, sentiment analysis, and user interface enhancements to create a comprehensive and engaging review display system.
